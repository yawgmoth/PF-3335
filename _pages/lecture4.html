# Artificial Intelligence: Planning

# The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)

  * In The Olden Days every planner used their own input format
  
  * The formats not only differed in syntax, but also in capabilities
  
  * In 1998 Drew McDermott and colleagues developed a standardized language for planning problems: PDDL
  
  * This made comparisons between different planners easier and lead to the creating of the International Planning Competition
  
---
class: medium

# PDDL Influences

  * STRIPS, as we have heard, represented operators as preconditions, additions and deletions
  
  * Other languages, such as ADL, supported a wider variety of formulas as preconditions and effects

  * The idea of actions having "preconditions", that describe when they are applicable, and "effects" that describe what is changed, was common to many of them
  
  * The "core" of PDDL is therefore the definition of actions
  
---

class: medium

# PDDL Layout

  * PDDL separates a planning problem into two files
  
     - The domain, which defines how the actions operate
     - The problem, which defines the initial state and the goal
  
  * The idea is that the domain can be reused for many different problems
  
  * Since historically many planners were written in LISP, PDDL uses the same basic syntax: S-Expressions
  
---

# S-Expressions

 * Simply put, an S-Expression consists of parenthesized list, where each element can be either a literal string or another S-Expression
 
 * (Classically S-Expressions are defined as having two elements, which are concatenated with a period `.`, but this is not commonly explicitly used anymore)
 
 * For example, these are all valid S-Expression:

```
()
(and (or (not a) b (and (not x) c d e) e))
(defun fib (n) (if (lt n 2) 1 (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
```

---

# S-Expressions

  * Why are S-Expressions useful?
  
  * They are very simple to parse, and we can use them to represent syntax trees
  
  * That's exactly what you will do in task 3 of the project
  
  * Let's look into how we'd parse them

---

class: medium

# Parsing S-Expressions

  * Tokenize the input
  
  * Consume tokens one at a time, and push them onto a stack, until you encounter a closing parenthesis
  
  * When you encounter a closing parenthesis, pop items from the stack until you find the *first* opening parenthesis on the stack
  
  * Push a list containing all popped items onto the stack
  
  * Continue consuming tokens
  
  * When the last token has been consumed, the stack will contain a single item: The list representing the S-Expression
  
---

# Parsing S-Expressions: An Example

```
(and (or (not a) b) e)
```
Push tokens until we encounter the first closing parenthesis:
```
a
not
(
or
(
and
(
```
Pop `a`, `not` and `(`, and push the list containing them:
```
[not, a]
or
(
and
(
```


---

# Parsing S-Expressions: An Example

```
(and (or (not a) b) e)
                 ^
```
Push tokens until we encounter the next closing parenthesis
```
b
[not, a]
or
(
and
(
```
Pop `b`, `[not, a]`, `or`, and `(` and push the list containing them:
```
[or, [not, a], b]
and
(
```

---

# Parsing S-Expressions: An Example

```
(and (or (not a) b) e)
                    ^
```
Push tokens until we encounter the next closing parenthesis
```
e
[or, [not, a], b]
and
(
```
Pop `and`, `[or, [not, a], b]`, `and`, and `(` and push the list containing them:
```
[and, [or, [not, a], b], e]
```
We have reached the end of the tokens, and the only item on our stack is the list representing the S-Expression

---

# Practical considerations

  * We need to tokenize our input: The list elements are separated by spaces, but we have to ensure the parentheses are too
  
  * If we ever try to pop from an empty stack, or if there is more than one element on the stack at the end, there was a syntax error
  
  * The literal strings can contain pretty much any character except for parenthesis and spaces (we saw `-` earlier as a literal string)

---

# Structure of a PDDL Domain File

.left-column[

]

.right-column[

* Now we have our PDDL domain file as a parse-tree

* Let's extract the individual parts

* For each part we have to do some processing

* After all processing, we have our domain

]

---

# Types

* Objects and variables in PDDL can have types

* Types form a hierarchy, with a root type containing *all* objects

* We need to store these types so we can expand variables in e.g. forall expressions

---

# Types

* Types are written *after* objects

* A type can be applied to multiple objects at the same time

```
p3 p6 - going_up
p5 p3 p6 p2 p9 p1 - attendant
p7 - never_alone
p2 p7 - conflict_A
p0 p9 p3 p6 p1 p8 p5 p4 - conflict_B
f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9
f10 f11 f12 f13 f14 f15 f16 f17 f18 f19 - floor
```

---

# Type Hierarchy

* Similar to giving types to objects, types can also be "applied" to other types

* This is used to create a type hierarchy, by saying "everything that has type X or Y also has type Z" by writing `X Y - Z`

```
passenger - object
going_up going_down vip
going_nonstop attendant never_alone
conflict_A conflict_B - passenger
floor - object

```

---

class: medium


# Parsing Types

* As usual, tokenize the input

* Store types as a dictionary of sets

* Process token by token, collecting items in a accumulator set

* When you encounter a `-`, interpret the next token as a type

* Add all objects from the accumulator set to that type's set in the dictionary

---

# Type Hierarchy

* You can use the same approach to process the type hierarchy

* Then you need to perform a post-processing step

* For each type, add all objects of each of its subtypes

* Either do this from the bottom up, or just repeat it n times

---

# Actions

* Actions in PDDL are actually action schemata/*operators*

* That means they contain free variables

* Each operator may represent multiple actions

* Additionally, each operator contains a precondition and an effect

---

# Action Example

```
(:action up
  :parameters (?f1 - floor
               ?f2 - floor)
  :precondition (and (lift-at ?f1)
                     (above ?f1 ?f2))
  :effect (and (lift-at ?f2)
               (not (lift-at ?f1)))
)
```

---

# Extensions

* PDDL is a standard, but it allows for several extensions

* The planner you implement in the project will support

   - `:strips`
   - `:typing`
   - `:adl`, which is an abbreviation for `:disjunctive-preconditions`, `:equality`, `:existential-preconditions`, `:universal-preconditions`, and
     `:conditional-effects`

* There are many other extensions, related to numbers, temporal planning, probabilistic effects, etc.
 
---

# Structure of a PDDL Problem File

.left-column[

]

.right-column[

* The *domain* defines the available operators of the world

* The *problem* defines the initial state and the goal condition

* Objects may be spread out over both files

]

---

# An Example

```
(:objects p0 - passenger
             f0 f1 - floor)


(:init
(above f0 f1)
(origin p0 f1)
(destin p0 f0)
(lift-at f0)
)


(:goal (forall (?p - passenger) (served ?p)))
```

# Running a Planner

* Most planners will provide you with some executable that expects two parameters: a domain file, and a problem file

* Some will then perform some preprocessing step and translate the problem into some internal representation, and you may have to run a second executable on that

* Then you wait ...

--

* And wait ...

--

* And wait ...

--

* And then you get a solution (or not)!

# Some Planners

* FastForward

* FastDownward

* Glaive

---

# Plans

* So you run your planner and it finishes

* The output will be a "plan"

* However, unlike for the input, there is no real standard for the output

---

# planning.domains

* Since planning is a very active field of research, there are many planning domains out there

* [planning.domains](planning.domains) actually contains a collection of known domains, drawing from planning competitions and other sources

* All of the files in that repository are PDDL files

* However, they may require various extensions

---

# Some Advice For the Project

* For the project, testing your planner on the classical domains is a good idea

* On the project page, you will find information on which domains should work with your planner

* There are also other sources for domains, some of which are linked on the project page

* If you find anything else, please let me know, and I'll test them with my solution

---

# Performance

* With task 3, your planner will be quite slow

* There will still be a decent amount of problems you should be able to solve

* Check the project page for performance metrics of my solution for comparison

* In task 4 we will improve this performance (and we will talk next week about how)
